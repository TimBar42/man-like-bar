### II. The Brand Personality & Voice

"Man Like Bar" embodies the spirit of the local pub—it's **social, witty, and high-quality but unpretentious.**

#### 🎯 Target Audience
The **"Local Legend"**—an individual who:
* Values **premium materials** (heavyweight cotton, quality fits).
* Has a **relaxed, social lifestyle** (meeting the lads at 5).
* Appreciates **dry, pub-centric humor** and banter.
* Ages: Late 20s to early 40s (Suggested by "heavyweight" and "premium" streetwear positioning).

#### 🗣️ Brand Tone of Voice

| Trait | How it Sounds | Do's and Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Witty & Humorous** | Use pub slang, irony, and self-aware jokes. | **DO:** "Guaranteed to start conversations or end them", "Designated Drinker," "Irish Exit". **DON'T:** Be overly crude, mean-spirited, or preachy about alcohol consumption. |
| **Premium & Confident** | Use strong, decisive language when discussing product quality. | **DO:** "Premium heavyweight cotton," "400GSM Cotton. Built to spill", "Premium Fits". **DON'T:** Use terms like "cheap," "budget," or "fast fashion." |
| **Authentic & Casual** | Keep it relatable to the social experience. Avoid corporate jargon. | **DO:** "Born on a sticky floor in East London", "Trusted by 5,000+ Regulars". **DON'T:** Sound overly polished or like a luxury brand. |

The "Man Like Bar" voice is rooted in dry British humor, pub camaraderie, and a self-deprecating appreciation for the social ritual of drinking.

#### Key Tone Pillars

| Tone Pillar | Description | Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Punter** | Relatable, slightly mischievous, and speaks from the consumer's experience (the "Designated Drinker" or the "Last Call" warrior). | Social Media Copy, Product Names |
| **The Quality Control** | Confident and authoritative when discussing fabrics and construction. Uses technical terms (GSM, organic cotton) to justify the premium price. | Product Descriptions, "About Us" Page |
| **The Landlord's Wit** | Dry, observational, and based on common bar scenarios—the "sticky floor," the "Irish Exit," the "tab open." | Email Subject Lines, Error Messages (404), Promo Bar |

#### Copywriting Examples by Platform

| Platform / Context | Goal | Example Copy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Promo Bar/Header** | Drive conversion using the themed shipping rule. | **"FREE SHIPPING ON ORDERS OVER 3 PINTS (OR $100)"** |
| **Hero Headline** | Witty summary of the brand promise. | **"Wear the Pub. Literally."** |
| **Call to Action (CTA)** | Create a sense of urgency and fun. | Shop The New Edit: **Get 'em before last orders.** |
| **Product Description** | Balance humor with quality detail. | **The "Designated Drinker" Tee.** 100% heavyweight cotton that survives the wash—and the night out. *Relaxed fits for relaxed pints.* |
| **Email Subject Line** | Grab attention with pub-centric urgency. | **(Reminder) Your tab is still open!** (Abandoned Cart) / **New drop: It’s your round.** |
| **Social Media Post (Instagram)** | Engage with relatable lifestyle content. | *That moment you realise you forgot your card, but your mate's already gone home.* Good thing this fit is premium. #ManLikeBar |
| **404 Error Page** | Maintain brand voice even in utility spaces. | **404: The Pint You Ordered Isn't Here.** It's probably down the road. Try our new arrivals instead. |
| **Footer Microcopy** | Lighthearted compliance and brand sign-off. | *© 2023 Man Like Bar Ltd. Please drink (and dress) responsibly.* |

### III. Visual & Design Assets

#### 🎨 Color Palette
The palette is a mix of muted, classic streetwear tones accented by a vibrant, eye-catching color that evokes a pint of ale or an amber liquid.

| Color | Hex Code | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stone Black** (Primary) | `#1c1917` (stone-900) | **Core Text, Primary CTA Background** (Shop Collection Button) |
| **Stone Grey** (Neutral) | `#78716c` (stone-500) | Secondary text, body copy, background for lifestyle images. |
| **Orange Accent** (Highlight) | `#ea580c` (orange-600) | **Call to Action Hover States, Logo Dot, Highlighted Text** (e.g., "Fresh from the Tap" tag) |
| **Stone White** (Background) | `#f5f5f4` (stone-50) | Main background color, ensuring a clean, modern canvas. |

#### ✒️ Typography
The brand uses a modern, legible, and slightly blocky typeface that balances the playful humor with the premium streetwear feel.

* **Primary Font:** **Inter** (Used for all display and body text).
    * **Style:** Use a variety of weights (Medium for headings, Regular/Light for body).
* **Logo Treatment:** **Bold, Uppercase, Tracking-Tighter** with the Orange Accent used as a period/dot after the brand name.
    * *Example:* **MAN LIKE BAR.**

#### 📸 Imagery Style
Imagery should directly connect the product to the pub environment while maintaining a fashion-forward look.

* **Aesthetic:** Cinematic, slightly moody, and real-world (not studio-perfect).
* **Execution:** Products shown being worn in bar/pub settings. High contrast. *The use of a **grayscale filter with a hover-to-color transition*** on the Hero image is a key visual device that must be maintained for all lead photography to emphasize the *premium* yet *raw/authentic* feel.
* **Product Focus:** Focus on fit and fabric texture ("heavyweight cotton").

### IV. Product & Merchandising

#### 🛍️ Merchandising Structure
Products should be categorized by both product type and the overarching "Bar Poison" theme, allowing for creative naming conventions.

* **Core Categories:** Tees, Hoodies/Outerwear, Barware/Accessories.
* **Theming Examples:** The "Last Call" Heavyweight Tee, The "Designated Drinker" Tee, "Tab Open" Dad Cap.

#### 📦 The "Pint" Pricing/Shipping Model
The brand should lean into its theme for logistics communication.

* **Rule:** **FREE SHIPPING ON ORDERS OVER 3 PINTS (OR $100)**.
    * *Guidance:* Use the "Pint" metric ($33.33 USD equivalent) in all promotional communications where possible to reinforce the theme.
